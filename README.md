### Hi there, I'm [Mike](https://mike-larson.me/ ) ðŸ‘‹ 

### About Me
I am a Software Engineer, specializing in web development. For the last 4 years, I have been developing software using JavaScript, Python, C++, and other programming languages.

Iâ€™m currently employed as a software engineering intern at Meter Group in Pullman, WA. When I first started I designed and implemented an automated testing suite using Robot Framework. As I learned the code base I started to be tasked with bug fixes which helped me increase my knowledge of the system. Now my tasks include solving bugs and developing new features.

One of the things that I love about software engineering is the constant challenges that exist. These challenges force you to constantly learn new things and make you think in different ways. The skills that I've learned along the way can be seen in my projects.

Some of the projects that I have recently worked on include:
- My Personal Portfolio: This project utilizes the MERN Stack to deliver a responsive website for phones and computers. This site is used to showcase my abilities as a programmer and can be found here https://mike-larson.me/ 

- Virtual Classroom Simulator: This project was written by our team for the WSU hackathon. We used C# and Unity to create an application that allowed students to connect in a virtual environment. This app allows students to proximity chat with voice and video when they moved around the virtual school.
